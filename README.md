# shell-config
This is the config I use to work with.

## Instalation

1. clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/wilgoszpl/shell-config.git ~/bin`
2. Add this line to your `~/.bash_profile` file

```shell
source ~/bin/.source.sh
```

## Script list

1. Git branch color
2. Git command autocomplete
3. Git aliases
4. Git rewrite author
5. Project specific script structurization
6. Shell color schemes

If you want to add commands for project specific environment setup, just add `project-specific/private.sh` and list sources of private files there.

I name private project_files started from `_` - those files are also ingnored in this repository.
